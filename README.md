# FastAPI Code Implementation

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. The project showcases the core features and functionality of FastAPI, including:

- Defining path operations and request/response models
- Handling query parameters, path parameters, request bodies, and other common HTTP components
- Implementing authentication and authorization with OAuth2 and JWT tokens
- Using dependency injection for reusable logic
- Handling exceptions and returning appropriate HTTP status codes
- Serving static files and HTML pages
- Structuring a FastAPI application with modular routers, schemas, and dependencies

## Project Structure

Initially, the project was written in a single file called `root.py`. While this single-file implementation is functional and can still be run directly, it is lengthy and less maintainable for larger projects. To address this, the codebase was modularized into a more maintainable structure.

- **`main.py`**: The main entry point for the modularized FastAPI application, importing and including the various routers.
- **`root.py`**: Contains the original single-file implementation of the FastAPI project. This file can also be run directly, but it is less organized than the modularized version.
- **`router/`**: Contains the individual routers for different functional areas, such as items, users, files, filters, and products.
- **`schemas/`**: Defines the Pydantic models used for request and response data.
- **`dependencies/`**: Includes reusable dependencies, such as authentication and authorization functions.
- **`databases/`** *(Optional)*: Includes any database-related code, such as models, queries, or ORM interactions.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-complete-code.git

```
### Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment
- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate

```
- On Unix/macOS:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install the Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the FastAPI Application
- To run the modularized implementation (recommended):

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload

```
The application will start running at http://localhost:8000. You can visit the auto-generated API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs.

- To run the single-file implementation (optional)
```bash
uvicorn root:app --reload
```
While functional, this version is less organized and more challenging to maintain.

## Usage

The main functionality of the application is divided into the following routers:

### Items Router

Provides CRUD operations for managing items. Example endpoints:

```bash
GET /items/
POST /items/
PUT /items/{item_id}
DELETE /items/{item_id}
```
Users Router
Handles user-related functionality, such as authentication, user profiles, and role management. Example endpoints:

```bash
GET /users/
POST /users/
```
Files Router
Supports file uploads and downloads. Example endpoints:

```bash
POST /files/upload
GET /files/download/{file_id}
```

Filters Router
Demonstrates the use of query parameters and filters. Example endpoint:
```bash
GET /filters/?query=example
```
Products Router
Includes endpoints for managing product-related data. Example endpoints:

```bash
GET /products/
POST /products/
```
You can explore all available endpoints and their detailed documentation in the Swagger UI at:
```bash

```
### Notes
## The root.py file serves as a reference for how the project evolved from a single-file implementation to a modular structure. It is not intended for production use.

## The modularized version in main.py is more maintainable, scalable, and better suited for real-world applications.
